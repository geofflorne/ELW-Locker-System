    <p class="question"><em>There are no lockers currently open</em> </p>  
    <br>
    <p class="question" onclick="show_more('answer1')">What do I do?</p>  
    <p class="answer" id="answer1" style="display:none;">-Check to see if there are any lockers without locks on them, send the admin information about the locker, and he/she can check if there is still someone using that locker. (ie. They have it reserved, but have no use for it)
        <br>
    -Wait until the locker re-register date, this happens near the beginning of every semester, so if it is exam period or just before the start of a semester, wait a few weeks 
        <br>
    - Check the ECS building; remember, they user a different online system

    <p class="question" onclick="show_more('answer2')">But I saw lockers without locks?</p>  
    <p class="answer" id="answer2" style="display:none;">This does not mean they are open for registration. We ask students to keep locks on the locker they have registered to avoid confusion, however even if there is no lock on the locker, it still belongs to the student who registered it for that semester. Contact the admin and he/she can ask that student if they are still using the locker.
